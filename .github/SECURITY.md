# Security Policy

## Introduction

The CutMate team takes the security of our application and the protection of user data very seriously. This document outlines our security protocols, vulnerability reporting process, and commitments to maintaining a secure environment for all users.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |

| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We greatly appreciate the efforts of security researchers and users who help identify potential vulnerabilities in our application. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until we have had a chance to address it.
2. Email your findings to security@cutmate.app (Note: This is a placeholder email - replace with your actual security contact).
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including:
   - A description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested mitigations if you have them

**Response Timeline:**
- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
- We aim to provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability within 7 days.
- We will keep you informed of our progress as we work to address the issue.
- Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will notify you and may invite you to verify the fix.

## Security Implementation Details

### Data Protection

1. **Encryption:**
   - All personal data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption.
   - All data in transit is protected using TLS 1.3.
   - Local data on devices is stored in encrypted format when possible.

2. **Data Minimization:**
   - We collect only the data necessary for the app's functionality.
   - Users have control over what optional data they wish to provide.

3. **Retention Policy:**
   - User data is retained for a maximum of 3 years, or for 1 year after account deletion.
   - Anonymized aggregate data may be kept longer for analytical purposes.

### Authentication & Access Control

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Strong password requirements
   - Support for multi-factor authentication
   - Automatic session timeout after period of inactivity
   - Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

2. **Authorization:**
   - Principle of least privilege for all system components
   - Regular review of access permissions

### Third-Party Components

1. **Dependency Management:**
   - Regular updates of all dependencies to address security vulnerabilities
   - Automated monitoring of dependencies for known vulnerabilities
   - Verification of package integrity

2. **API Security:**
   - Strict API key management
   - Rate limiting on all API endpoints
   - Input validation and sanitization

### AI and Machine Learning Security

1. **Model Security:**
   - Protection against prompt injection attacks
   - Regular evaluation of AI outputs for security concerns
   - Fallback mechanisms for when AI services are unavailable

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Clear user consent for AI processing of their data
   - Anonymization of data used for model training where possible
   - Transparency about AI usage in the application

### Mobile Application Security

1. **App Hardening:**
   - Prevention of reverse engineering through code obfuscation
   - Detection of rooted/jailbroken devices
   - Secure storage of API keys and credentials

2. **Client-side Validation:**
   - All client-side validations are duplicated on the server
   - Protection against common mobile vulnerabilities (OWASP Mobile Top 10)

## Security Compliance

CutMate is designed to comply with the following security and privacy standards:

- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- Swiss Data Protection Act
- OWASP Secure Coding Practices

## Security Testing

Our security practices include:

1. **Regular Testing:**
   - Automated security scanning in our CI/CD pipeline
   - Periodic penetration testing by security professionals
   - Vulnerability scanning of infrastructure and dependencies

2. **Code Review:**
   - Mandatory security review for all code changes
   - Static analysis tools integrated into development workflow

## Incident Response

In the event of a security incident:

1. We will promptly investigate and contain the incident
2. We will assess the impact and the affected users/data
3. We will notify affected users in accordance with applicable laws and regulations
4. We will implement measures to prevent similar incidents in the future

## Security Update Process

Security updates will be distributed through:
- App store updates (high priority updates will be expedited)
- Server-side changes for back-end vulnerabilities
- Public disclosure of fixed vulnerabilities (after sufficient time for user updates)

## Contact

For security-related inquiries or to report vulnerabilities, please contact:
- Email: security@cutmate.app (placeholder - update with actual contact)

## Updates to This Policy

This security policy will be reviewed and updated regularly. Users will be notified of significant changes to our security practices.
