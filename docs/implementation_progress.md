| Weight Tracking | ‚úÖ Completed | Implemented weight entry form with validation and local storage | Uses SharedPreferences for persistence |
| Progress Visualization | ‚úÖ Completed | Created charts for weight history and progress metrics | Uses fl_chart for visualization |
| State Management | ‚úÖ Completed | Implemented Provider pattern for weight data | WeightProvider with ChangeNotifier |
| Meal Recommendations | ‚úÖ Completed | Implemented meal screen with AI integration using Mistral-7B | Uses a local Mistral API with fallback meal suggestions |
| Enhanced Meal System | ‚úÖ Completed | Added feedback mechanisms and ingredient-based recommendations | User can provide likes/dislikes for better recommendations |
| Code Consolidation | ‚úÖ Completed | Consolidated duplicate code files into single, maintainable versions | Improved project structure and maintainability |
| User Profile | üîÑ In Progress | Model created, UI pending | Data structure defined |
| Shareable Content | üìù Planned | Not started | Viral hooks pending |
| Onboarding | üìù Planned | Not started | To be implemented in next phase |

## Core Components Implemented

### Data Models
- **WeightEntry**: Model for weight tracking data points
- **User**: Model for user profile and preferences

### Services
- **StorageService**: Service for local data persistence
- **WeightProvider**: State management for weight data
- **MealService**: Service for generating and retrieving meal recommendations
- **MealProvider**: State management for meal recommendations and user feedback
- **SettingsProvider**: Manages app settings including theme preferences
- **NotificationService**: Handles local notifications and reminders

### Screens
- **MainScreen**: Container with bottom navigation
- **HomeScreen**: Dashboard with feature cards
- **ProgressScreen**: Weight tracking visualization
- **WeightEntryScreen**: Form for logging weight
- **MealScreen**: Primary meal recommendation interface
- **EnhancedMealTestScreen**: Testing interface for enhanced meal recommendations
- **SettingsScreen**: User preferences and app configuration

## Technical Details

- Used **Provider** package for state management
- Implemented **SharedPreferences** for local data storage
- Created data serialization methods (toJson/fromJson)
- Designed responsive UI for different screen sizes
- Implemented form validation for data entry

## Next Steps

1. **Enhance Meal Recommendation System**
   - Refine feedback mechanisms
   - Add meal favoriting functionality
   - Improve relevance scoring algorithm

2. **Implement User Profile**
   - Create profile screen with settings
   - Implement goal setting functionality
   - Add onboarding flow for first-time users

3. **Develop Shareable Content**
   - Design meal cards for social sharing
   - Create milestone GIFs for achievements
   - Implement native sharing functionality

## Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Data persistence | Implemented SharedPreferences with JSON serialization for initial MVP. Will upgrade to SQLite or Hive in future iterations for better performance with larger datasets |
| Chart visualization | Used fl_chart package to create custom weight trend charts with customized appearance to match app theme |
| State management | Provider pattern implemented for maintainable state management. May consider more robust solutions like Bloc or Riverpod if complexity increases |

## Alignment with Project Goals

The current implementation establishes the foundation for the core value proposition:
- ‚úÖ Weight tracking with minimal friction
- ‚úÖ Visual progress feedback 
- üîÑ Working toward AI meal guidance (in progress)
- üìù Viral sharing features (planned)

## Resource Utilization

The application is being developed within the specified constraints:
- Single developer implementation
- Using open-source UI components
- Staying within the specified technology stack (Flutter)
- No additional budget requirements so far
