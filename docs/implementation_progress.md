**Date:** May 28, 2025
**Version:** 0.1.0
**Status:** Development in Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation progress of the CutMate application against the requirements specified in the project fact sheet.

## Implementation Status

| Feature | Status | Implementation Details | Notes |
|---------|--------|------------------------|-------|
| Project Structure | ‚úÖ Completed | Created proper Flutter project structure with folders for screens, models, services, theme, and constants | Follows standard Flutter architecture |
| App Navigation | ‚úÖ Completed | Implemented bottom navigation with tabs for Home, Meals, Progress, and Profile | MainScreen component with navigation state |
| Theme Implementation | ‚úÖ Completed | Created light and dark themes based on brand guidelines | Uses primary color #2F80FF with supporting color scheme |
| Weight Tracking | ‚úÖ Completed | Implemented weight entry form with validation and local storage | Uses SharedPreferences for persistence |
| Progress Visualization | ‚úÖ Completed | Created charts for weight history and progress metrics | Uses fl_chart for visualization |
| State Management | ‚úÖ Completed | Implemented Provider pattern for weight data | WeightProvider with ChangeNotifier |
| Meal Recommendations | üîÑ In Progress | Placeholder UI created | Pending AI integration |
| User Profile | üîÑ In Progress | Model created, UI pending | Data structure defined |
| Shareable Content | üìù Planned | Not started | Viral hooks pending |
| Onboarding | üìù Planned | Not started | To be implemented in next phase |

## Core Components Implemented

### Data Models
- **WeightEntry**: Model for weight tracking data points
- **User**: Model for user profile and preferences

### Services
- **StorageService**: Service for local data persistence
- **WeightProvider**: State management for weight data

### Screens
- **MainScreen**: Container with bottom navigation
- **HomeScreen**: Dashboard with feature cards
- **ProgressScreen**: Weight tracking visualization
- **WeightEntryScreen**: Form for logging weight

## Technical Details

- Used **Provider** package for state management
- Implemented **SharedPreferences** for local data storage
- Created data serialization methods (toJson/fromJson)
- Designed responsive UI for different screen sizes
- Implemented form validation for data entry

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Meal Recommendation Screen**
   - Design and implement UI for meal recommendations
   - Create data models for meals and recipes
   - Integrate with OpenAI API for meal suggestions

2. **Implement User Profile**
   - Create profile screen with settings
   - Implement goal setting functionality
   - Add onboarding flow for first-time users

3. **Develop Shareable Content**
   - Design meal cards for social sharing
   - Create milestone GIFs for achievements
   - Implement native sharing functionality

## Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Data persistence | Implemented SharedPreferences with JSON serialization for initial MVP. Will upgrade to SQLite or Hive in future iterations for better performance with larger datasets |
| Chart visualization | Used fl_chart package to create custom weight trend charts with customized appearance to match app theme |
| State management | Provider pattern implemented for maintainable state management. May consider more robust solutions like Bloc or Riverpod if complexity increases |

## Alignment with Project Goals

The current implementation establishes the foundation for the core value proposition:
- ‚úÖ Weight tracking with minimal friction
- ‚úÖ Visual progress feedback 
- üîÑ Working toward AI meal guidance (in progress)
- üìù Viral sharing features (planned)

## Resource Utilization

The application is being developed within the specified constraints:
- Single developer implementation
- Using open-source UI components
- Staying within the specified technology stack (Flutter)
- No additional budget requirements so far
