1. **Home**: Main dashboard with feature cards
2. **Meals**: AI meal recommendations (coming soon)
3. **Progress**: Weight tracking charts and history
4. **Profile**: User profile and settings (coming soon)

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Consistency Is Key**: Log your weight at the same time each day (ideally in the morning after using the bathroom)
2. **Add Notes**: Include context with your weight entries to help identify patterns
3. **Weekly Review**: Check your progress chart weekly rather than daily to see the bigger trend
4. **Set Realistic Goals**: Healthy weight loss is typically 0.5-1kg per week

## Troubleshooting

### No Weight Data Appearing
- Make sure you've logged at least one weight entry
- Check that you've tapped "Save Weight" after entering data

### Chart Not Showing
- You need at least 2 weight entries for the chart to display
- Try logging weights for multiple days
