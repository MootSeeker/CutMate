# CutMate – Branding Decisions (v0.2)

**Last updated:** 27 May 2025

## 1. Chosen App Name

**CutMate**

* Domain to secure: **cutmate.app** (status: appears available – verify ASAP).
* Social handles to register: @cutmateapp (TikTok, Instagram, X).
* Tagline (draft): *“Your AI wingman for cutting weight, not corners.”*

## 2. Logo Direction

* **Style:** Abstract symbol (no literal dumbbell/scale).
* **Concept:** Minimal flame/torch merged with check-mark, geometric, easily recognisable at 48×48 px.
* Versions: full-color, monochrome (white, black), outline.

## 3. Core Palette (confirmed)

| Role             | Hex     |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| Primary accent   | #2F80FF |
| Dark surface     | #111827 |
| Light background | #F7F7F7 |
| Success/Goal     | #10B981 |
| Warning          | #F59E0B |

## 4. Viral Hooks – MVP Scope

| Feature                     | Include in MVP? | Notes                                                        |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AI Meal Flex Pic            | **Yes**         | Auto-composed meal image + “Cook it with CutMate” share card |
| Milestone GIF (weight drop) | **Yes**         | Auto-generated mini-animation upon –1 kg, –5 kg, etc.        |
| Streak Badge                | Later           | Nice-to-have post-MVP                                        |
| 30-Day Leaderboard          | Later           | Post-launch community feature                                |

## 5. Next Tasks

1. Trademark / domain purchase for CutMate.
2. Commission or design abstract flame-check logo (SVG).
3. Build share-card / GIF generator POC (evaluate Canvas vs server-side renderer).
4. Update Fact Sheet v0.3 to reference **CutMate** as official product name.
