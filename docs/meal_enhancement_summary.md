# CutMate Meal Recommendation Enhancement

## Overview

The CutMate application has been enhanced with an improved meal recommendation system that addresses several key issues with the previous implementation:

1. **Improved AI Response Handling**: More robust parsing of AI-generated meal suggestions with multiple fallback strategies
2. **Better Ingredient Matching**: Sophisticated matching of available ingredients to recommended meals
3. **User Feedback System**: Collection and utilization of user feedback to improve recommendations
4. **Enhanced UI Components**: Visual feedback and relevance scoring in the meal display

## Integration Status

As of June 9, 2025, the enhanced meal recommendation system has been partially integrated into the main application:

- ✅ Updated `main.dart` to use the enhanced meal provider
- ✅ Modified `meal_screen.dart` to use the enhanced meal card with feedback
- ✅ Added a test screen for the advanced features
- ✅ Documented integration progress and next steps

## User Benefits

The enhanced meal recommendation system provides the following benefits:

1. **More Relevant Meals**: Recommendations are tailored to the ingredients users have available
